classic, the MK38 is an exceptional vehicle tuned for ultimate off-road performance. Featuring military-grade durability and a perfect combination of torque output and fuel consumption, this truck is a powerhouse of industrial transportation. However, all that military might comes with a cost. Due to stringent design guidelines, the truck includes a non-replaceable sideboard frame that is incompatible with other rear add-ons.","UI_VEHICLE_ANK_MK38_NAME":"ANK MK38","UI_VEHICLE_ANK_MK38_CIVILIAN_DESC":"A modification of ANK MK38, lacking its original proprietary sideboard in favor of more generic mounts fit for installing commonly used civilian frame addons, as well as fuel tanks and repair modules. Unlike its military version, this model offers enough performance but more torque offering flexibility in carrying heavier supplies.","UI_VEHICLE_ANK_MK38_CIVILIAN_NAME":"ANK MK38 CIVILIAN","UI_VEHICLE_ARAMATSU_FORESTER_DESC":"Aramatsu Forester is a very niche kind of vehicle that is designed with one single purpose in mind - logging operations. Its versatile frame provides better stability and higher performance on logging sites, and can mount a unique crane to simplify the loading process. Another distinctive feature of this truck is an articulated cab that rotates in tandem with the crane making loading the truck easier than ever.","UI_VEHICLE_ARAMATSU_FORESTER__NAME":"Aramatsu Forester","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_4220_ANTARCTIC_DESC":"A prototype polar expedition vehicle, the Antarctic is designed to excel in the deep freeze conditions of the Far North. Outfitted with armored wheels the size of a small family car, a unique fuel-efficient powertrain, and an impressively sizeable fuel tank, this truck can downright ignore almost any obstacle unfortunate enough to stand in its way. Due to its articulated frame design, it is only compatible with certain frame add-ons.","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_4220_ANTARCTIC_NAME":"Azov 42-20 Antarctic","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_42_191_SPRINTER_DESC":"Based on a widely popular, mass-produced model, the Azov 43-191 Sprinter is much more than just a fancier coat of paint on a boring military vehicle. From thoroughly reworked drivetrain and an all-new engine and suspension system to a tailor-made lightweight polymer chassis, every component of this truck is designed to give it an edge over the competition both on and off the road. That said, being a specialist rally vehicle, the Sprinter is not equipped to carry any cargo other than supplies for minor field repairs.","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_42_191_SPRINTER__NAME":"Azov 43-191 \\"Sprinter\\"","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_5319_DESC":"Azov 5319 is an armored 8x8 truck currently being used by the Russian military. Its military-grade tires and armored engine compartment makes it nearly impervious to damage, but this protection comes at a cost. The additional frame weight requires an engine with a healthy appetite for fuel, rendering this truck heavily reliant on supply chain.","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_5319_NAME":"Azov 5319","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_64131_DESC":"One of the more rare truck configurations, this vehicle is an odd case. Featuring a powerful yet somewhat finicky engine and an 8x8 configuration, it is advertised as a general purpose off-road vehicle despite being arguably too heavy for that class. While its impressive power output could prove to be useful for excessively heavy cargo, this truck might require some work to make it more confident off the road.","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_64131_NAME":"Azov 64131","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_73210_DESC":"An experimental proof-of-concept truck on a 10x10 chassis, the 73-210 was intended to be used as a wheeled crane carrier. It features a heavy base chassis to allow for most truck-portable crane configurations, as well as a spacious fuel tank for prolonged operation away from civilization. The main drawbacks of this prototype include relatively lackluster suspension and engine armoring, which were intended to be improved before the model reached mass production stage.","UI_VEHICLE_AZOV_73210_NAME":"Azov 73210","UI_VEHICLE_BOAR_45318_DESC":"A made-to-order off-road truck originating from Russia, BOAR is both impressively powerful and large for its class. Designed to carry specialized equipment across service roads or complete off-road environment, this model focuses entirely on performance, only leaving enough space on its frame for various kinds of saddles and other specialized equipment, leaving actual carry capacity entirely up to trailers and semi-trailers.","UI_VEHICLE_BOAR_45318_NAME":"BOAR 45318","UI_VEHICLE_CAT_745C_DESC":"Most trucks are designed to perform a variety of roles, sacrificing extreme performance in a specific area in favor of overall versatility.

COLUMBIA","UI_REGION_ALL_NAME":"ALL","UI_REGION_MICHIGAN_DESC":"Michigan is no stranger to poor weather conditions, from the frigid winds coming from the Great Lakes and winters cold enough to drive one\'s truck on ice for fishing, to heavy rains and devastating floods destroying infrastructure and driving people out of their homes. This time, the recent downpours were especially harsh to one of the local industries, threatening their entire operation in this state.","UI_REGION_ALASKA_DESC":"The harsh Alaskan wilds were always a desirable, if difficult target for many oil companies. These days, an oil tycoon by the name of \\"Black Bird\\" has laid their claim on the large deposit of the black gold hidden deep under the showy plains. Scattered with oilrigs and covered in an intricate web of petrolium lines, the region is still a constant source of new challenges for the company, and with them, employment for freelance truckers.","UI_REGION_YAKUTIA_DESC":"The Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) is a federal Russian republic. It is the largest subnational governing body by area in the world at 3,083,523 square kilometers (1,190,555 sq mi). It is known for its extreme and severe climate, with winter averages often dropping below −35 °C (−31 °F) in Yakutsk.","UI_REGION_TAIMYR_DESC":"Surrounded by dense Syberian woods and cold unwelcoming ocean, the city of Zimnegorsk was once a prominent resource base for all of the surrounding towns. From lumbermills to mines and oil rigs, what used to be the industrial heart of the region is now but a shadow of its former self, full of deserted or unfinished factories and eerily empty streets. However, a regional oil company decided the now-decrepit city may still have some potential.","UI_REGION_KOLSKIY_DESC":"Surrounded by freezing-cold seas, the Kola peninsula is one of the Northernmost parts of the European Russia. Although most of it might seem to be an endless wall of taiga forests interspersed with an occasional river or a sheer cliff, its unwelcoming facade hides many secrets that attract all kinds of history enthusiasts every year. Even now, yet another expedition to the places of past military glory is in need of capable drivers...","UI_REGION_WISCONSIN_DESC":"Back in the late twentieth century, most of this region\'s infrastructure was quite literally washed off the face of the planet by record levels of runoff. Recently, in spite of potential danger, the area saw an influx of lumber businesses attempting to tap into the vast forests abundant in this part of the state.","UI_REGION_YUKON_DESC":"The valley next to the Big Salmon Peak used to be an important mining spot back in the times of Alaskan Gold Rush. Nowadays, this area oftentimes gets flooded by the nearby river, which doesn\'t prevent the local companies from attempting to develop the Yukon depths.","UI_REGION_AMUR_DESC":"One of the southern-most regions of Russia, Amurskaya Oblast\' is well-known for warm summers and surprisingly harsh winters. In the early days of space exploration, some of the great minds of the time envisioned this place to become another vantage point for exploring the stars. And while these days the decades-old cosmodrome serves as little more than a monument to its visioners\' ambition, a freshly formed space agency had recently shown interest in giving this frontier a second life.","UI_REGION_ROSTOV_DESC":"Rostov Oblast is located in South-West of the Russian Federation. The local climate is warm, with hot summers, so-called \'gold\' autumns and very mild winters. The entire region is split by one of Europe\'s largest rivers - river Don. It is fed by numerous tributaries and splits into many branches, while its shores house countless coal, oil, metallurgical, and even vehicle factories, which in turn creates an unusual contrast between peaceful villages and loud, towering industrial sites. Historically, a lot of these facilities were later either abandoned or semi-permanently put out of commission; and while some of them are fated to crumble to dust, others may yet receive a chance for a new life.","UI_REGION_MAINE_DESC":"Maine is well-known for its tall peaks and beautiful nature. When a cold cyclone struck the state at the onset of the rainfall season, one of the nearby rivers overflowed, leaving the locals with a full-on flood on top of iced-over roads and shores. This, however, can do little to disrupt a wood processing company\'s plans to construct a new lumber mill. And if that was not enough, the region almost completely lacks well-equipped garages, making the job of upgrading the infrastructure that more challenging.","UI_REGION_TENNESSEE_DESC":"Located in the Southern part of the United States, Tennessee consists of three geographically - and legally - distinct \\"Grand Divisions\\" - East, Middle, and West Tennessee, each represented on the state\'s flag by its own star. For a long time, a certain abandoned mine in the Western part of the state was used to host an annual off-road championship known as the Tennessee OffRoad Cup. The event itself consists of three stages: classic one-lap racing, extreme downhill, and off-road navigation challenge. Additional multiplayer challenges are also available on the track.","UI_REGION_BELOZERSK_DESC":"Located in Central Asia, Belozersk Glades is a largely agrarian region with most of its economy split between farming and gas industries. Bordering steppes from the South and being mostly covered in sparse forests, it enjoys extreme continental climate, with hot summers and incredibly cold winters. Despite this, Belozersk still made its name as an agrarian region, and while its focus has shifted towards mineral and oil industries in the last decades, some make a compelling case for restoring the area\'s prior farmland glory.","UI_REGION_ONTARIO_DESC":"Somewhere in the east of Canada, there is a land of countless lakes and rivers, towering mountains and dense forests — the snow-covered region of Ontario. Here, on the shores of river Albany, gold-mining enterprises are looking for hidden deposits of precious metal, while local citizens go on with their lives at an unhurried pace. Only the employees of the local fire department get no rest — for reasons unknown, they have to work day and night, covered in sweat and soot...","UI_REGION_BRITISH_COLUMBIA_DESC":"British Columbia is Canada\'s west-most region. It is famous for its magnificent mountains, international ports and abundant tourism destinations. Unfortunately, a huge flood disturbed this quiet place. Nature changed the plans of local residents and industries alike. The region has to address the public unrest, rebuild important facilities and fulfill some special contracts.","UI_REGION_MAP_HEADER":"Region Map","UI_REGION_USA":"NORTH AMERICA","UI_REGION_RUSSIA":"RUSSIA","UI_REGION_MAP":"Global Map","level_us_09_01":"The Albany River","level_us_09_02":"Burned Forest","level_us_10_01":"Duncan Bay","level_us_10_02":"North Peak National Park","UI_REGIONAL_MAP_GARAGE_OPENED":"Garage is available","UI_REGION_MAP_CARGO_MAP_INFO":"Cargo Info","UI_REGION_MAP_TRUCK_MAP_INFO":"Truck Info","UI_ADDON_IS_LOCKED_FOR_BUY":"Addon is locked for buying","UI_DEFAULT_ADDON_NAME":"Addon","UI_GARAGE_LOG_RESTORE_FUEL":"Restore Fuel","UI_TRUCK_INFO_INSTALLED":"ADDON INSTALLED","UI_TRUCK_INFO_NO":"NO","UI_TRUCK_INFO_YES":"YES","UI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_GAMEPAD_DISCONNECTED_TITLE":"WARNING","UI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_GAMEPAD_DISCONNECTED_TEXT_PC":"Your controller has been disconnected.
