## Features

* Increase your money and rank
* Make tasks and missions easier by partially completing them. This is especially useful for the redundant logging tasks. For example, you can reduce a task to require only 1 load by marking other loads as complete.
* Reveal hidden upgrade locations, and obtain the upgrades if you're really lazy.

## Important Notes

* You must accept the task or mission in the game before it shows up here.
* Using the editor to fully complete a task or mission will work, but you will not receive rewards for it. It is recommended to complete the last part of the task in the game.
* Always make a backup of your saved game file, just in case.

## Instructions
Load the **CompleteSave.cfg** file:\
With **steam**, the file is located in *[steam install]/userdata/[steam_id]/1465360/remote.*\
With **epic or other platforms**, navigate to *%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\SnowRunner\base\storage*.
You will see a folder with a generated key like *9544ed6c186247e1bfeb0df3f9d013a8*. The file is located in this folder.
